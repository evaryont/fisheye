{"name":"Fisheye","tagline":"A multi-tenant, multi-protocol identity server (OpenID, BrowserID)","body":"# fisheye - A multi-tenant, multi-protocol identity provider\r\n\r\nMe, online, in all of it's fabulousness. Also, it tries really hard to be the\r\none-stop-shop for all of my authentication needs. Which currently are:\r\n\r\n- BrowserID\r\n- OpenID\r\n\r\nThis application is fairly barebones, it doesn't need to do much outside of\r\nauthenticating a person. It's not a web site -- it only does OpenID & BrowserID,\r\nand even then, it doesn't actually do that itself, thanks to the fantastic Ruby\r\ncommunity. :smile: This is mostly glue so that other libraries are exposed.\r\n\r\nFisheye is designed to be multi-tenant, meaning that it is not only for just one\r\nperson, but any number of people can use it.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\n- [masq](https://github.com/dennisreimann/masq)\r\n- [browserid-provider](https://github.com/ringe/browserid-provider)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Single-sign-on across all identities -- they aren't just 2+ protocols that\r\n  happen to be on the same server, but they are indeed supposed to be different\r\n  representations of the exact same user. (Which of course means that your\r\n  password works for both OpenID **and** BrowserID!)\r\n- Includes [VeriSign's SeatBelt][seatbelt] configuration (thanks to masq),\r\n  which is a Firefox plugin that will auto-fill OpenID input fields on websites\r\n  that support OpenID. Neat!\r\n- Email activation, 'cause it's nice to know that there is a real email on the\r\n  other side of these identities.\r\n\r\n[seatbelt]: https://pip.verisignlabs.com/seatbelt.do\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n1. Download fisheye:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   git clone https://github.com/evaryont/fisheye.git\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Make sure all of the dependencies are installed:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   bundle install --deployment\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Edit the configuration file for masq:\r\n   ```\r\n   vim config/masq.yml\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Run migrations to get the DB schema loaded:\r\n   ```\r\n   bundle exec rake db:migrate\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nWhen you first run Rails, `browserid-provider` will generate a private certificate\r\nin config/browserid\\_provider.pem.
